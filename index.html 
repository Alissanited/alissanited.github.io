 <h1>What has Alissa been up to?</h1>
 <h2>"Alissa is not the craftiest person that ever existed. However, she enjoys sports that don't require hand-eye coordination because that skills exists less in Alissa than her artistic skills. She loves adventurous experiences. Alissa has experienced snorkeling, zip lining, hiking through a cave and many other fun activities. Over quarantine, Alissa got a chance to enjoy more of the ocean. She started open-water swimming and surfing. Alissa has definitely gotten better at not being anxious in the ocean and trusting herself."</h2>
